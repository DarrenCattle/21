                    Several months ago we started a 21-day challenge to see how well we could keep our word. We wanted to become people who do what they say they're going to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The challenge:</strong> Pick something you want to improve. Do it for 21 days straight. No excuses. If you miss a day, you're back to day zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The results:</strong> Productivity at our company increased 30-40%. We didn't just become aware of how well we stuck to our challenge. We started noticing what we were commiting to in other areas of our lives and more importantly, how well we were keeping our promises.
